The \\napproach taken by Feistel’s group, and now used in the MK \\nXI1 IFF system, is to vary the exchange cryptographically \\nfrom encounter to encounter. The radar sends a randomly \\nselected challenge and judges the aircraft by whether it \\nreceives a correctly encrypted response. Because the chal- \\nlenges are never repeated, previously recorded responses \\nwill not be judged correct by a challenging radar. \\nLater in the decade, this novel authentication technique \\nwas joined by another, which seems first to have been \\n560 \\n001&9219/88/0500-0560$01.00 0 1988 IEEE \\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 76, NO. 5, MAY 1988'),\n",

The tables gather all of the \\npasswards together in one place and anyone who gets \\naccess to this information can impersonate any of the sys- \\ntem‘s users. To guard against this possibility, the password \\ntable is filled not with the passwords themselves, but with \\nthe images of the passwords under a one-way function. A \\none-way function is easy to compute, but difficult to invert. \\nFor any password, the correct table entry can be calculated \\neasily. Given an output from the one-way function, how- \\never, it is exceedingly difficult to find any input that will \\nproduce it. This reduces the value of the password table to \\nan intruder tremendously, since its entries are not pass- \\nwords and are not acceptable to the password verification \\nroutine. \\nChallenge and response identification and one-wayfunc- \\ntions provide protection against two quite different sorts \\nof threats. Challengeand response identification resists the \\nefforts of an eavesdropper who can spy on the commu- \\nnication channel. Since the challengevaries randomlyfrom \\nevent to event, the spy is unable to replay it and fool the \\nchallenging radar. There is, however, no protection against \\nan opponent who captures the radar and learns its cryp- \\ntographic keys. This opponent can use what he has learned \\nto fool any other radar that is keyed the same. In contrast, \\nthe one-way function defeats the efforts of an intruder who \\ncaptures the system password table (analogous to captur- \\ning the radar) but scuccumbs to anyone who intercepts the \\nlogin message because the password does not change with \\ntime. \\nI realized that the two goals might be achieved simul- \\ntaneously if the challenger could pose questions that it was \\nunable to answer, but whose answers it could judge for cor- \\nrectness. I saw the solution as a generalization of the one- \\nway function: a trap-door one-way function that allowed \\nsomeone in possession of secret information to go back- \\nwards and compute the function’s inverse. The challenger \\nwould issue a value in the range of the one-way function \\nand demand to know its inverse. Onlythe person who knew \\nthe trapdoor would be able to find the corresponding ele- \\nment in the domain, but the challenger, in possession of \\nan algorithm for computing the one-way function, could \\nreadilychecktheanswer. In theapplicaticnsthat later came \\ntoseem most important, the roleof thechallengewas played \\nby a message and the process took on the character of a \\nsignature, a digital signature. \\nIt did not take long to realize that the trap-door one-way \\nfunction could also be applied to the baffling problem of \\nkey distribution. For someone in possession of the forward \\nform of the one-way function to send a secret message to \\nthe person who knew the trapdoor, he had only to trans- \\nform the message with the one-way function. Only the \\nholder of the trap-door information would be able to invert \\nthe operation and recover the message. Because knowing \\nthe forward form of the function did not make it possible \\nto compute the inverse, the function could be made freely \\navailable. It is this possibility that gave the field its name: \\npublic-ke y cryptography. \\nThe concept that emerges is that of a public-key cryp- \\ntosystem: a cryptosystem in which keys come in inverse \\npairs [36] and each pair of keys has two properties. \\n- Anything encrypted with one key can be decrypted \\nwith the other. \\nGiven one member of the pair, the public key, it is \\ninfeasible to discover the other, the secret key. \\nThis separation of encryption and decryption makes it \\npossible for the subscribers to a communication system to \\nlist their public keys in a “telephone directory” along with \\ntheir names and addresses. This done, the solutions to the \\noriginal problems can be achieved by simple protocols. \\nOne subscriber can send a private message to another \\nsimply by looking up the addressee’s public key and \\nusing it to encrypt the message. Only the holder of the \\ncorresponding secret key can read such a message; \\neven the sender, should he lose the plaintext, is inca- \\npable of extracting it from the ciphertext. \\nA subscriber can sign a message by encrypting it with \\nhis own secret key. Anyone with access to the public \\nkey can verify that it must have been encrypted with \\nthe corresponding secret key, but this is of no help to \\nhim in creating (forging) a message with this property. \\nThe first aspect of public-key cryptography greatly sim- \\nplifies the management of keys, especially in large com- \\nmunication networks. In order for a pair of subscribers to \\ncommunicate privately using conventional end-to-end \\ncryptography, they must both have copies of the same cryp- \\ntographic key and this key must be kept secret from anyone \\nthey do not wish to take into their confidence. If a network \\nhas only a few subscribers, each person simply stores one \\nkey for every other subscriber against the day he will need \\nit, but for a large network, this is impractical. \\nIn a network with n subscribers there are n(n - 1)/2 pairs, \\neach of which may require a key. This amounts to five thou- \\nsand keys in a network with only a hundred subscribers, \\nhalf a million in a network with one thousand, and twenty \\nmillion billion in a network the size of the North American \\ntelephone system. It is unthinkable to distribute this many \\nkeys in advance and undesirable to postpone secure com- \\nmunication while they are carried from one party to the \\nother by courier. \\nThe second aspect makes its possible to conduct a much \\nbroader range of normal business practices over a tele- \\ncommunication network. Theavailabilityof asignature that \\nthe receiver of a message cannot forge and the sender can- \\nnot readily disavow makes it possible to trust the network \\nwith negotiations and transactions of much higher value \\nthan would otherwise be possible. \\nIt must be noted that both problems can be solved with- \\nout public-key cryptography, but that conventional solu- \\ntions come at a great price. Centralized key distribution \\ncenters can on request provide a subscriber with a key for \\ncommunicating with any other subscriber and protocols \\nfor this purpose will be discussed later on. The function of \\nthe signature can also beapproximated byacentral registry \\nthat records all transactions and bears witness in cases of \\ndispute. Both mechanisms, however, encumber the net- \\nwork with the intrusion of a third party into many conver- \\nsations, diminishing security and degrading performance. \\nAt the time public-key cryptography was discovered, I \\nwas working with Martin Hellman in the Electrical Engi- \\nneering Department at Stanford University. It was our \\nimmediate reaction, and by no means ours alone, that the \\nDIFFIE: TEN YEARS OF PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY 561')],\n",

Esto ha revolucionado la seguridad en las comunicaciones y ha permitido firmar mensajes digitales. Se descubrió en 1975 y ha tenido un impacto sorprendente en la seguridad de las comunicaciones. Se resuelven problemas de distribución de claves y de firmas digitales.
